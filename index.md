# 1. Abstract
Autonomous driving systems are confronted with the formidable challenge of navigating intricate and dynamic environments rife with uncertainty. This study presents a unified prediction and planning framework, concurrently modeling short-term aleatoric uncertainty (SAU), long-term aleatoric uncertainty (LAU), and epistemic uncertainty (EU) in prediction and establish a robust foundation for planning in dynamic contexts. SAU captures inherent randomness in the behavior of traffic participants, while LAU accounts for their diverse behavioral patterns. EU encompasses uncertainties arising from inadequate model cognition.
The framework leverages advanced modeling techniques, including gaussian mixture models and deep ensemble methods, to effectively capture and assess SAU, LAU, and EU.
Additionally, the uncertainty-aware planning is introduced, considering various uncertainties. The study's contributions include comprehensive comparisons of various uncertainty estimation, risk modeling, and planning methods, including comparisons with existing approaches.
The proposed methods is rigorously evaluated using the CommonRoad benchmark and settings involving limited perception. These experiments provide a systematic and lucid perspective, illuminating the advantages and roles of different uncertainty factors in the autonomous driving process.
In addition, comparative assessments of various uncertainty modeling strategies underscore the benefits of modeling multiple types of uncertainties, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing planning accuracy and reliability.
